        <h1>Git Merge Conflicts</h1>
        <p>When you merge branches in Git, you may run into a merge conflict. This happens when you merge branches that have competing changes, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge.</p>
        <p>When a merge conflict occurs, Git will tell you that a file has a conflict, and it will show you the conflicting changes. For example:</p>
        <pre>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
This is the original text.
=======
This is the conflicting text that was added in the branch you're merging in.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; branch-name
        </pre>
        <p>To resolve the conflict, you need to edit the file to remove the conflict markers and conflicting lines, and then commit the changes. After that, you can complete the merge.</p>
        <p>It's important to resolve merge conflicts carefully, as they can cause errors in your code if not handled correctly. It's a good idea to review the changes and test your code after resolving a merge conflict to make sure everything is working as expected.</p>
